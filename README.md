Abstract
========

To Do
-----

Work on handling UI better.


Bugs
----

No currently known bugs.


Features
--------

Gravity vertices and electronic vertices move based on the vertices around them.

Energy vertex can power other vertices.

Rotator vertex can rotate other vertices connected by an edge, if powered.


Planned Features
----------------

* More vertex types:
	* Light vertex
	* Extend vertex
	* Timer vertex
* Checking nearby collisions using hex-grids for partitions
* Maybe take advantage of the hex-grids and make something that uses them and makes them **visible**.

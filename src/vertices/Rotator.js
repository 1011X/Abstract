/// Rotates an edge-connected component

/// The rotator works by taking the sum of all the energy received and
/// distributing it across its edge neighbors based on their distance. The
/// linear velocity of all edge neighbors are the same.

/// To make this interesting, let's make this more complicated than it needs to.
/// Here, we're equally distributing the total incoming energy, and distributing
/// it equally between each edge neighbor. We follow the equation of rotational
/// energy, with a moment of inertia equal to that of a rod with unit mass and
/// length equal to the distance between the vertices.

/// Visually:
///     E_rot = 1/2 I w^2
///           = 1/2 (1/3 m_rod l_rod^2) w^2 ; I = 1/3 m_rod l_rod^2
///           = 1/2 (1/3 r^2) (v/r)^2       ; l_rod = r, m_rod = 1, w = v/r
///           = 1/6 v^2
/// Solving for v, this will give us the linear velocity for the vertex.
///     v = sqrt(6 E_rot)
